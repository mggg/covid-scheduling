    We enumerate the possible testing schedules based on the configuration's
    block schedule, site availability, and testing interval constraints.
    We then solve the person-schedule matching problem using the specified
    method; in particular, we seek an assignment that minimizes the total
    matching cost, where the cost of matching a person with a testing schedule
    is determined by `cost_fn`. This matching problem may also be subject
    to side constraints, such as site-day and site-block load balancing.

    Matches are returned in a schema similar to the person roster's
    schema; any unsuccessful matches (which typically occur due to lack of
    availability) are marked clearly with an error message.

            matching is available; heuristic algorithms may be
            added in the future).
        cost_fn: A function which expects a person, a schedule, and a target
            testing interval (in days) and returns a `float` indicating
            the cost of matching the person with the testing schedule.

            and the person's testing history. This function does _not_
            need to determine if the person's schedule is compatible
            with the testing schedule; this is handled internally
            by the assignment algorithms.

    """Augments a list of schedules with site permutations.

    We consider two primary dimensions when scheduling: *when* a person
    gets tested and *where* a person gets tested. Just as people have
    preferred testing times, they may have preferred testing sites
    depending on the locations of their dormitories and classroom buildings.
    Each test site typically has distinct hours and capacities. Thus,
    it is useful to consider schedules with the same blocks but different
    testing sites separately.

    Given a list of schedules (typically generated with `cohort_schedules`),
    we can make a schedule site-specific in two ways:
        1. For each site, generate a copy of the schedule with *all* blocks
           assigned to the same site. For each schedule, this yields a set of
           augmented schedules with size linear in the number of sites.
        2. For each schedule, enumerate all Cartesian products of sites with
           the length of the schedule---that is, allow the site to vary across
           appointments for each schedule. For each schedule, this yields a set
           of augmented schedules with size exponential in the number of sites.
           This is feasible for a small number of sites.

    By default, we choose the former. Preventing schedules from splitting
    across sites is not just more computationally tractable; the schedules
    this method produces are more user-friendly, as switching between testing
    sites in the same (short) time interval is annoying. However, we retain
    support for the latter. It can be enabled by setting `allow_site_splits` to
    `True` in the configuration's `params` field.

    In either case, we filter out infeasible schedules. If a schedule contains
    a block assigned to a site that is not actually open during that block,
    then the entire schedule is invalid. (If a site is only partially open
    during an assigned block, the schedule is still valid.)
