    """Assigns people to testing schedules.

    We enumerate the possible testing schedules based on the configuration's
    block schedule, site availability, and testing interval constraints.
    We then solve the person-schedule matching problem using the specified
    method; in particular, we seek an assignment that minimizes the total
    matching cost, where the cost of matching a person with a testing schedule
    is determined by `cost_fn`. This matching problem may also be subject
    to side constraints, such as site-day and site-block load balancing.

    Matches are returned in a schema similar to the person roster's
    schema; any unsuccessful matches (which typically occur due to lack of
    availability) are marked clearly with an error message.

    Args:
        config: A validated university-level configuration.
        people: A validated roster of people.
        start_date: The first day of testing. Only date information is used.
        end_date: The last day of testing (inclusive).
            Only date information is used.
        method: The assignment algorithm to use (only bipartite
            matching is available; heuristic algorithms may be
            added in the future).
        cost_fn: A function which expects a person, a schedule, and a target
            testing interval (in days) and returns a `float` indicating
            the cost of matching the person with the testing schedule.
            In practice, this function should use information about the
            schedule's testing interval, the person's site preferences,
            and the person's testing history. This function does _not_
            need to determine if the person's schedule is compatible
            with the testing schedule; this is handled internally
            by the assignment algorithms.

    Returns:
        Testing schedules for each person (with warnings).

    Raises:
        AssignmentError:
            * When the testing window is too long or starts before it ends.
            * When the specified `method` does not exist.
            * When the assignment problem is invalid with respect to the
              `method` chosen.
